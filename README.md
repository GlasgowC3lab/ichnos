# Carbon-Footprint
A project with scripts to methodically calculate the Carbon Footprint of Workflow Executions from Nextflow trace files.

# Credits
- [Carbon Footprint](scripts/CarbonFootprint.py) is adapted from the [nf-co2footprint](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-co2footprint) plugin which was based on the carbon footprint computation method developed in the [Green Algorithms](https://www.green-algorithms.org/) project.

- [Carbon Intensity](scripts/CarbonIntensity.py) makes use of the [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/).
- [Nextflow Trace Files](data/trace/) are generated from [Nextflow]() workflow executions.
