# Carbon-Footprint
A project with scripts to methodically calculate the Carbon Footprint of Workflow Executions from Nextflow trace files.

# Usage
For the initial version, replicating the previous calculation approach noted in the Credits section, example usage has been provided with default values:
> $ python -m src.scripts.CarbonFootprint <trace-file-name> <carbon-intensity> <power-usage-effectiveness> <cpu-power-draw> <memory-power-draw>"
> $ python -m src.scripts.CarbonFootprint test-trace 475 1.67 12 0.3725
Note that the trace file name must be the file name only, and traces should be csv files stored in the [data trace](data/trace/) directory!
Future plans will look at using CI values based on the time interval that the trace was executed in, and inclusion of variable cpu and memory power draw values. 

# Credits
- [Carbon Footprint](src/scripts/CarbonFootprint.py) is adapted from the [nf-co2footprint](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-co2footprint) plugin which was based on the carbon footprint computation method developed in the [Green Algorithms](https://www.green-algorithms.org/) project.

- [Carbon Intensity](src/scripts/CarbonIntensity.py) makes use of the [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/).
- [Nextflow Trace Files](data/trace/) are generated from [Nextflow]() workflow executions.
